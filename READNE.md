# ESP32 - Interrupt Service Routines - A Joy Forever!

Just a small demo project to teach myself how to properly do ISRs using Rust abstractions.

Check out `main.rs` for most of the run.

The code has lines in the form `<number>. <comment` which you can read through.

## Prerequisites

* [Espressif ESP32-DevKitC-32E](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc) from a reputable source
* [Rust ESP32 toolchain](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/index.html)
* Patience... Lots of it!

## Crash & Burn

```shell
$ . ~/export-esp.sh
$ cargo run
```
